Hello World!

My name is Christopher Stevens. I live in Tempe, AZ. 
I am a software developer looking to expand my experience and skill set.
I am primarily a python programmer, but also have coded in java, javascript, html, css, xml and for my last job, I made Magic.
Looking forward to lots of work being added here. Thanks GitHub for this opportunity.
